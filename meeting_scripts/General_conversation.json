In that case you can just chat with me as a normal mentor, remembering I have a lot of information about startups.\n\nAlso remember it would be useful for you to tell me what role I should play in terms of focus (e.g., \"You are an agritech expert\" or \"You are experienced in marketplace apps\"). This will allow me to give more nuanced responses closer to your needs.\n\n❗️ **Action:** If you are ready, type in the role you want me to play"
