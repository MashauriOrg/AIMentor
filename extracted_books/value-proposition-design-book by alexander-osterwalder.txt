Jobs describe the things your customers are 
trying to get done in their work or in their life.  
A customer job could be the tasks they are trying to perform and complete, the problems they are trying to solve, or the needs they are trying to satisfy. Make sure you take the customer’s perspective when investigating jobs. What you think of as important from your perspective might not be a job customers are actually trying to get done.
* 
 Distinguish between three main types of 
customer jobs to be done and supporting jobs:
functional jobs 
When your customers try to perform or complete a specific task or solve a specific problem, for example, mow the lawn, eat healthy as a consumer, write a report, or help clients as  a professional.
Social jobs
When your customers want to look good or gain power or status. These jobs describe how custom-ers want to be perceived by others, for example, look trendy as a consumer or be perceived as competent as a professional. 
Personal/emotional jobs 
When your customers seek a specific emotional state, such as feeling good or secure, for example, seeking peace of mind regarding one’s invest-ments as a consumer or achieving the feeling of job security at one’s workplace.  Supporting jobs
Customers also perform supporting jobs in the context of purchasing and consuming value either as consumers or as professionals. These jobs arise from three different roles:
•	BUYER OF VALUE: jobs related to buying 
value, such as comparing offers, deciding which products to buy, standing in a checkout line, completing a purchase, or taking delivery of  
a product or service.    
•	COCREATOR OF VALUE: jobs related to  
cocreating value with your organization, such  as posting product reviews and feedback or even participating in the design of a product  or service. 
•	TRANSFERRER OF VALUE: jobs related to the end of a value proposition’s life cycle, such as canceling a subscription, disposing of a product, transferring it to others, or reselling it.
* The jobs to be done concept was developed independently 
by several business thinkers including Anthony Ulwick of the 
consulting firm Strategyn, consultants Rick Pedi and Bob 
Moesta, and Professor Denise Nitterhouse of DePaul University. It was popularized by Clay Christensen and his consulting firm Innosight and Anthony Ulwick’s Strategyn.12

VPD_book_39.indd   12 9/22/2014   1:06:00 PMJob context
Customer jobs often depend on the specific 
context in which they are performed. The context may impose certain constraints or limitations.  For example, calling somebody on the fly is different when you are traveling on a train than when you are driving a car. Likewise, going to the movies with your kids is different than going with your partner.   
+
-important
insignificantJob importance
It is important to acknowledge that not all jobs have the same importance to your customer. Some matter more in a customer’s work or life because failing to get them done could have serious ramifi -
cations. Some are insignificant because the customer cares about other things more. Sometimes a customer will deem a job crucial because it occurs frequently or because it will result in a desired or unwanted outcome.

VPD_book_39.indd   13 9/22/2014   1:06:01 PMCustomer Pains
Pains describe anything that annoys your custom-
ers before, during, and after trying to get a job done or simply prevents them from getting a job done. Pains also describe risks, that is, potential bad outcomes, related to getting a job done badly or not at all. 
Seek to identify three types of customer pains and 
how severe customers find them: 
undesired outcomes, problems,  
and characteristics
Pains are functional (e.g., a solution doesn’t work, doesn’t work well, or has negative side effects), social (“I look bad doing this”), emotional (“I feel bad every time I do this”), or ancillary (“It’s annoy-ing to go to the store for this”). This may also involve undesired characteristics customers don’t like (e.g., “Running at the gym is boring,” or “This design is ugly”). 
obstacles
These are things that prevent customers from even getting started with a job or that slow them down (e.g., “I lack the time to get this job done accurately,” or “I can’t afford any of the existing solutions”). Risks (undesired potential outcomes)
What could go wrong and have important neg-ative consequences (e.g., “I might lose credibility when using this type of solution,” or “A security breach would be disastrous for us”).
Tip: Make pains concrete.To clearly differentiate jobs, pains, and gains, describe them as concretely as possible. For example, when a customer says “waiting in line was a waste of time,” ask after how many minutes exactly it began to feel like wasted time. That way you can note “wasting more than x minutes stand-ing in line.” When you understand how exactly customers measure pain severity, you can design better pain relievers in your value proposition.+
-Extreme
ModeratePain severity
A customer pain can be extreme or moderate, similar to how jobs can be important or insignificant to the customer.14

•	What are the main difficulties and challenges your customers encounter? Do they understand how things work, have difficulties getting certain things done, or resist particular jobs for specific reasons?
•	What negative social consequences do your customers encounter or fear? Are they afraid of a loss of face, power, trust, or status?
•	What risks do your customers fear? Are they afraid of financial, social, or technical risks, or are they asking themselves what could go wrong?
•	What’s keeping your customers awake at night? What are their big issues, concerns, and worries?
•	What common mistakes do your customers make? Are they using a solution the wrong way?
•	What barriers are keeping your customers from adopting a value proposition? Are there upfront investment costs, a steep learning curve, or other obstacles preventing adoption?

STRATEGYZER.COM / VPD / CANVAS / 1.1
VPD_book_39.indd   15 9/22/2014   1:06:01 PMGains describe the outcomes and benefits your 
customers want. Some gains are required, expected, or desired by customers, and some would surprise them. Gains include functional utility, social gains, positive emotions, and cost savings. 
Seek to identify four types of customer gains in 
terms of outcomes and benefits:
Required gains
These are gains without which a solution wouldn’t work. For example, the most basic expectation that we have from a smartphone is that we can make a call with it.
Expected gains
These are relatively basic gains that we expect from a solution, even if it could work without them. For example, since Apple launched the iPhone, we expect phones to be well-designed and look good.   
Desired gains
These are gains that go beyond what we expect from a solution but would love to have if we could. These are usually gains that customers would come up with if you asked them. For example, we desire smartphones to be seamlessly integrated with our other devices. unexpected gains
These are gains that go beyond customer expec -
tations and desires. They wouldn’t even come up with them if you asked them. Before Apple brought touch screens and the App Store to the mainstream, nobody really thought of them as part of a phone. Customer Gains
Tip: Make gains concrete.
As with pains, it’s better to describe gains as concretely as possible to clearly differentiate jobs, pains, and gains from one another. Ask how much they’d expect or dream of when a customer indicates “better performance” as a desired gain. That way you can note “would love an increased performance of more than x.” When you under -
stand how exactly customers measure gains (i.e., outcomes and benefits), you can design better gain creators in your value proposition.+
-Essential
nice to haveGain relevance
A customer gain can feel essential or nice to have, just like pains can feel extreme or moderate to them.16

•	How do current value propositions delight your customers? Which specific features do they enjoy? What performance and quality do they expect?
•	What would make your customers’ jobs or lives easier? Could there be a flatter learning curve, more services, or lower costs of ownership?
•	What positive social consequences do your customers desire? What makes them look good? What increases their power or their status?
•	What are customers looking for most? Are they searching for good design, guarantees, specific or more features?
•	What do customers dream about? What do they aspire to achieve, or what would be a big relief to them?

VPD_book_39.indd   17 9/22/2014   1:06:01 PMProfi  le of a 
“Business Book Reader”
We chose to use potential readers of this book to illustrate 
the customer profi  le. We deliberately went beyond jobs, 
pains, and gains merely related to reading books, since we 
intended to design an innovative and more holistic value 
proposition for businesspeople in general. 
The customer profi  le sketched out on the right is informed by several inter-
views we conducted and thousands of interactions we had with workshop 
participants. However, it is not mandatory to start with preexisting customer 
knowledge. You may begin exploring ideas by sketching out a profi  le based 
on what you believe your potential customers look like. This is an excellent 
starting point to prepare customer interviews and tests regarding your 
assumptions about customer jobs, pains, and gains. Gains are benefi  ts, results, and 
characteristics that custom-
ers require or desire. They are 
outcomes of jobs or wanted char-
acteristics of a value proposition 
that help customers get a job 
done well. 
The more tangible and specifi  c 
you make pains and gains, the 
better. For example, “examples 
from my industry” is more 
concrete than “relevant to my 
context.” Ask customers how they 
measure gains and pains. Inves-
tigate how they measure success 
or failure of a job they want to 
get done. 
Make sure you deeply under-
stand your customer. If you have 
only a few sticky notes on your 
profi  le, that probably indicates a 
lack of customer understanding. 
Unearth as many jobs, pains, and 
gains as you can. Search beyond 
those directly related to your 
value proposition.

VPD_book_39.indd   19 9/22/2014   1:06:02 PMRanking Jobs,  
Pains, and Gains
Although individual customer preferences vary, you need to 
get a sense of customer priorities. Investigate which jobs the majority consider important or insignificant. Find out which pains they find extreme versus merely moderate. Learn which gains they find essential and which are simply nice to have.
Ranking jobs, pains, and gains is essential in order to design value proposi-
tions that address things customers really care about. Of course, it’s difficult to unearth what really matters to customers, but your understanding will improve with every customer interaction and experiment.  It doesn’t matter if you start out with a ranking that is based on what you 
think is important to your potential customers as long as you strive to test that ranking until it truly reflects priorities from the customer’s perspective.20

VPD_book_39.indd   23 9/22/2014   1:06:03 PMBest Practices for Mapping 
Jobs, Pains, and GainsAvoid frequently committed mistakes 
when profiling a customer, and instead follow these best practices.
    Common Mistakes
Mixing several  
customer segments  into one profile.Mixing jobs and outcomes.Focusing on functional jobs only and forgetting social and emotional jobs.Listing jobs, pains, and gains with your value proposition in mind.Identifying too few jobs, pains, and gains.Being too vague in descriptions of pains  and gains.
    Best Practices
Make a Value  Proposition Canvas for every different customer segment. If you sell to companies, ask yourself if you have different types of customers within each company (e.g., users, buyers).Jobs are the tasks customers are trying to perform, the problems they are trying to solve, or the needs they are trying to satisfy, whereas gains are the concrete outcomes they want to achieve—or avoid and eliminate in the case of pains.Sometimes social or emotional jobs are even more important than the “visible” functional jobs. “Looking good in front of others” might be more important than finding a great technical solution that helps complete the job effectively. When you map your customer, you should proceed like an anthro-pologist and “forget” what you are offering. For example, a business publisher should not map jobs, pains, and gains merely related to books, because a reader has the choice between business books, consul -
tants, YouTube videos, or even completing an MBA program or training. Go beyond the jobs, pains, and gains you intend or hope to address with your value proposition.A good customer profile is full of sticky notes, because most customers have a lot of pains and expect or desire a lot of gains. Map out all your (potential) customers’ important jobs, extreme pains, and essential gains.Make pains and gains tangible and concrete. Rather than just writing “salary increase” in gains, specify how much of an increase a customer is seeking. Rather than writing “takes too long” in pains, indicate how long “too long” actually is. This will allow you to understand how exactly customers measure success and failure.

VPD_book_39.indd   24 9/22/2014   1:06:03 PMPains vs. Gains
When you get started with the customer profile, 
you might simply put the same ideas in pains and gains as opposites of each other. For example, if one of the customers’ jobs to be done is “earn more money,” you might start by adding “salary increase” to gains and “salary decrease” to pains. 
Here’s a better way to do it:
•	Find out precisely how much more money the customer expects to earn so it feels like a gain and investigate what decrease would feel like a pain.
•	In the pains, add the barriers that prevent or make it difficult to get a job done. In our exam-ple the pain might be “my employer doesn’t give raises.”
•	In the pains, add the risks related to not getting the job done. In our example the pain could be “might not be able to afford my child’s future college tuition.”  Ask “why” several times until you  
really understand your customers’  
jobs to be done.
Another issue when you get started with the customer profile is that you might settle with a superficial understanding of your customer’s jobs. To avoid this, you need to ask yourself why a customer wants to perform a certain job to dig deeper toward the real motivations.  For example, why might a customer want to 
learn a foreign language? Maybe because the “real” customer job to be done is to improve his CV. Why does he want to improve his CV? Maybe because he wants to earn more money. Don’t settle until you really understand the 
underlying jobs to be done that really drive customers. 25

and Services
This is simply a list of what you offer. 
Think of it as all the items your cus-tomers can see in your shop window  
—metaphorically speaking. It’s an  
enumeration of all the products and services your value proposition builds on. This bundle of products and services helps your customers complete either functional, social, or emotional jobs or helps them satisfy basic needs. It is crucial to acknowledge that products and services don’t create value alone—only in relationship to a specific cus-tomer segment and their jobs, pains, and gains.
Your list of products and services may 
also include supporting ones that help your customers perform the roles of buyer (those that help customers compare offers, decide, and buy), co-creator (those that help custom-ers co-design value propositions), and transferrer (those that help customers dispose of a product). Your value proposition is likely to be composed  
of various types of products and services:
Physical/tangible
Goods, such as manufactured products.
intangible
Products such as copyrights or services such  as after-sales assistance.
Digital
Products such as music downloads or services such as online recommendations. 
financial 
Products such as investment funds and  insurances or services such as the financing  of a purchase.

VPD_book_39.indd   30 9/22/2014   1:06:04 PMPain Relievers
Pain relievers describe how exactly 
your products and services alleviate specific customer pains. They explicitly outline how you intend to eliminate or reduce some of the things that annoy your customers before, during, or after they are trying to complete a job or that prevent them from doing so. 
Great value propositions focus on pains 
that matter to customers, in particular extreme pains. You don’t need to come up with a pain reliever for every pain you’ve identified in the customer  
profile—no value proposition can do this. Great value propositions often focus only on few pains that they  
alleviate extremely well. The following list of trigger questions can help you 
think of different ways your products and services may help your customers alleviate pains. 
Ask yourself: Could your products and services… •	produce savings? In terms of time, money, or 
efforts. 
•	make your customers feel better? By killing frus-trations, annoyances, and other things that give customers a headache. 
•	fix underperforming solutions? By introducing new features, better performance, or enhanced quality. 
•	put an end to difficulties and challenges your customers encounter? By making things easier or eliminating obstacles. 
•	wipe out negative social consequences your customers encounter or fear? In terms of loss of face or lost power, trust, or status. 
•	eliminate risks your customers fear? In terms of financial, social, technical risks, or things that could potentially go wrong. 
•	help your customers better sleep at night? By addressing significant issues, diminishing concerns, or eliminating worries. 
•	limit or eradicate common mistakes customers make? By helping them use a solution the right way. 
•	eliminate barriers that are keeping your customer from adopting value propositions? Introducing lower or no upfront investment costs, a flatter learning curve, or eliminating other obstacles preventing adoption.+
-EssentialRelevance
A pain reliever can be more or less valuable to the customer. Make sure you differentiate between essential pain relievers and ones that are nice to have. The former relieve extreme issues, often in a radical way, and create a lot of value. The latter merely relieve moderate pains.nice to have

Gain creators describe how your prod-
ucts and services create customer gains. They explicitly outline how you intend to produce outcomes and benefits that your customer expects, desires, or would be surprised by, including functional utility, social gains, positive emotions, and cost savings. 
As with pain relievers, gain creators 
don’t need to address every gain  
identified in the customer profile.  
Focus on those that are relevant to customers and where your products and services can make a difference. The following list of trigger questions can help 
you think of different ways your products and services may help your customers obtain required, expected, desired, or unexpected outcomes and benefits. 
Ask yourself: Could your products and services…•	create savings that please your customers?  
In terms of time, money, and effort.
•	produce outcomes your customers expect or that exceed their expectations? By offering quality levels, more of something, or less of something. 
•	outperform current value propositions and delight your customers? Regarding specific features, performance, or quality. 
•	make your customers’ work or life easier? Via better usability, accessibility, more services,  or lower cost of ownership. 
•	create positive social consequences? By making them look good or producing an increase in power or status. 
•	do something specific that customers are  looking for? In terms of good design, guaran-tees, or specific or more features. 
•	fulfill a desire customers dream about? By helping them achieve their aspirations or getting relief from a hardship? 
•	produce positive outcomes matching your customers’ success and failure criteria? In terms of better performance or lower cost. +
-EssentialRelevance
A gain creator can produce more or less relevant outcomes and benefits for the customer just like we have seen for pain relievers. Make sure you differentiate between essential and nice to have gain creators.  nice to have•	help make adoption easier? Through lower cost, fewer investments, lower risk, better quality, improved performance, or better design.

“Naked” list of the products 
and services that your value proposition builds on to target a specifi  c customer segment.It’s okay to aggregate several 
value propositions into one.
Pain relievers outline how exactly your products and services kill customer pains. Each pain reliever addresses at least one or more pains or gains. Don’t add products or services here.Remarkable value propositions focus 
on jobs, pains, and gains that mat-ter to customers and achieve those exceedingly well. Again, you should not try to address all customer pains and gains. Focus on those that will make a diff  erence for your customer.34

VPD_book_39.indd   37 9/22/2014   1:06:07 PMPain relievers vs. Gain creators
Pain relievers and gain creators both create value 
for the customer in different ways. The difference is that the former specifically addresses pains in the customer profile, while the latter specifi-cally addresses gains. It is okay if either of them addresses pains and gains at the same time. The main goal of these two areas is to make the customer value creation of your products and services explicit. What is the difference with the pains  
and gains in the customer profile?
Pain relievers and gain creators are distinctly different from pains and gains. You have control over the former, whereas you don’t have control over the latter. You decide (i.e., design) how you intend to create value by addressing specific jobs, pains, and gains. You don’t decide over which jobs, pains, and gains the customer has. And no value proposition addresses all of a customer’s jobs, pains, and gains. The best ones address those that matter most to customers and do so extremely well. ?

VPD_book_39.indd   38 9/22/2014   1:06:07 PM    Common Mistakes
List all your products and services 
rather than just those targeted at a specific segment.Add products and services to the pain reliever and gain creator fields.Offer pain relievers and gain creators that have nothing to do with the pains and gains in the customer profile.Make the unrealistic attempt to address all customer pains and gains.
    Best Practices
Products and services create value only in relationship to a specific customer segment. List only the bundle of products and services that jointly form a value proposition for a specific customer segment.Pain relievers and gain creators are explanations or characteristics that make the value creation of your products and services explicit. Exam-ples include “helps save time” and “well-designed.”Remember that products and services don’t create value in absolute terms. It is always relative to customers’ jobs, pains, and gains.Realize that great value propositions are about making choices regard-ing which jobs, pains, and gains to address and which to forgo. No value proposition addresses all of them. If your value map indicates so, it’s probably because you’re not honest about all the jobs, pains, and gains that should be in your customer profile.

You achieve fit when customers get 
excited about your value proposition, which happens when you address important jobs, alleviate extreme pains, and create essential gains that customers care about. As we will explain throughout this book, fit is hard to find and maintain. Striving for fit is the essence of value proposition design.Customers expect and desire a lot from products 
and services, yet they also know they can’t have it all. Focus on those gains that matter most to customers and make a difference. 
Customers have a lot of pains. No organization can reasonably address all of them. Focus on those headaches that matter most and are insufficiently addressed. fit42

outcome
If a pain reliever or gain creator doesn’t fit 
anything, it may not be creating customer value. Don’t worry if you haven’t checked all pains/gains—you can’t satisfy them all. Ask yourself, how well does your value proposition really fit your customer?

VPD_book_39.indd   47 9/22/2014   1:06:10 PMSearching for Fit is the process of 
designing value propositions around products and services that meet jobs, pains, and gains that customers really care about. Fit between what a com-pany off  ers and what customers want is the number one requirement of a successful value proposition.
Fit happens in three stages. The fi  rst 
occurs when you identify relevant customer jobs, pains, and gains you believe you can address with your value proposition. The second occurs when customers positively react to your value proposition and it gets traction in the market. The start-up movement calls these problem-solution fi  t and product-market fi  t, respectively. The third occurs when you fi  nd a business model that is scalable and profi  table.

1. Problem-Solution fit 
Problem-solution fi  t takes place when you 
•	Have evidence that customers care about certain jobs, pains, and gains.
•	Designed a value proposition that addresses those jobs, pains, and gains.
At this stage you don’t yet have evidence that customers actually care about your value proposition.  This is when you strive to identify the jobs, pains, and gains that are most relevant to customers and design value propositions accord-ingly. You prototype multiple alternative value propositions to come up with the ones that produce the best fi  t. The fi  t you achieve is not yet proven and exists mainly on paper. Your next steps are to provide evidence that customers care about your value proposition or start over with designing a new one.In the Market
2. Product-Market fit 
Product-market fi  t takes place when you•	Have evidence that your products and services, pain relievers, and gain creators are actually creating customer value and getting traction in the market.
During this second phase, you strive to validate or invalidate the assumptions underlying your value proposition. You will inevitably learn that many of your early ideas simply don’t create customer value (i.e., customers don’t care) and will have to design new value propositions. Finding this second type of fi  t is a long and iterative process; it doesn’t happen overnight. In the Bank
3. Business Model fit
Business model fi  t takes place when you•	Have evidence that your value proposition can be embedded in a profi  table and scal-able business model.
A great value proposition without a great business model may mean suboptimal fi  nancial success or even lead to failure. No value prop-osition—however great—can survive without a sound business model. The search for business model fi  t entails a laborious back and forth between designing a value proposition that creates value for custom-ers and a business model that creates value for your organization. You don’t have business model fi  t until you can generate more revenues with your value proposition than you incur costs to create and deliver it (or “them” in the case of platform models with more than one interde-pendent value propositions). 49

Profi  les in B2B
Value propositions in business-to-
business (B2B) transactions typically involve several stakeholders in the search, evaluation, purchase, and use of a product or service. Each one has a diff  erent profi  le with diff  erent jobs, pains, and gains. Stakeholders can tilt the purchasing decision in one direction or another. Identify the most important ones and sketch out a Value Proposition Canvas for each one of them.
Profi  les vary according to the sector 
and size of organization, but they typically include the following roles:

Individuals or groups whose opinions might count 
and whom the decision maker might listen to, even in an informal way. 
Recommenders
The people carrying out the search and evalua-tion process and who make a formal recommen-dation for or against a purchase. 
Economic Buyers
The individual or group who controls the budget and who makes the actual purchase. Their concerns are typically about financial perfor -
mance and budgetary efficiency.  In some cases, the economic buyer may sit 
outside an organization, such as a government paying for the basic medical supply in nursing homes for elderly citizens.
Decision Makers
The person or group ultimately responsible for the choice of a product/service and for ordering the purchase decision. Decision makers usually have ultimate authority over the budget. End users
The ultimate beneficiaries of a product or service. For a business customer, end users can either be within their own organization (a manufacturer buying software for its designers), or they can be external customers (a device manufacturer buying chips for the smartphones it sells to consumers). End users may be passive or active, depending on how much say they have in the decision and purchase process.
Saboteurs
The people and groups who can obstruct or derail the process of searching, evaluating, and purchas-ing a product or a service. 
Decision makers typically sit inside the customer’s 
organization, whereas Influencers, recommenders, economic buyers, end users, and saboteurs can sit inside or outside the organization.Unbundling

Value propositions to the consumer may also involve several stakeholders in the search, evalu-ation, purchase, and use of a product or service. For example, consider a family that intends to buy a game console. In this situation, there is also a difference between the economic buyer, the influencer, the decision maker, the users, and the saboteurs. It therefore makes sense to sketch out a different Value Proposition Canvas for each stakeholder.51

Some business models work only 
with a combination of several value propositions and customer segments. In these situations, you require fi  t between each value proposition and its respective customer segment for the business model to work. 
Two common illustrations of multiple 
fi  ts are intermediary and platformbusiness models. intermediary
When a business sells a product or service 
through an intermediary, it eff  ectively needs to cater to two customers: the end customer and the intermediary itself. Without a clear value proposition to the intermediary, the off  er might not reach the end customer at all, or at least not with the same impact.
Haier has a value proposition to their interme-diary customer, the retailers, who are also the main channel for the end customer.Haier has a value proposition to the end customer, households.Chinese fi  rm Haier sells home appliances and electronics to households globally. It does this largely through retailers such as Carrefour, Walmart, and others. To be successful, Haier needs to craft an appealing value proposition both to households (the end customer) and to intermediary distributors.

Platforms function only when two or more actors 
interact and draw value within the same inter-dependent business model. Platforms are called double-sided when there are two such actors and multisided when there are more than two. A platform exists only when all sides are present in the model. 
Airbnb is an example of a double-sided platform. 
It is a website that connects local residents with extra space to rent out and travelers looking for alternatives to hotels as a place to stay. In such a case, the business model needs to hold two value propositions, one for local residents (called hosts) and one for travelers.-

graphic profiles of his customer segments. But this time he decides to complement this type of segmentation with customer profiles that highlight a customer’s jobs, pains, and gains.

The new approach: focusing on the jobs,

By sketching out a customer profi  le, you aim to 
uncover what really drives people, rather than just describing their socioeconomic characteristics. You investigate what they’re trying to achieve, their underlying motives, their objectives, and what’s holding them back. Doing so will broaden your horizon and likely uncover new or better opportunities to satisfy customers. JANE MOVIEGOER

in our example, the context 
in which our moviegoer fi  nds 
herself will infl  uence which jobs 
matter more or less to her. 
Add contextual elements to your 
customer profi  les if necessary. They might serve as constraints for designing value propositions later on.Priorities change depending on a cus-
tomer’s context. Taking this context into account before you think of a value proposition for that customer is crucial. 
With the jobs-to-be-done approach, you uncover 
the motivations of diff  erent customer segments. Yet, depending on the context, some jobs will become more important or matter less than others.  In fact, the context in which a person fi  nds himself or herself often changes the nature of the jobs that the person aims to accomplish.  For example, the clientele of a restaurant is likely to use very diff  erent criteria to evaluate their dining experience at lunch versus at dinner. Likewise a mobile phone user will have diff  erent job requirements when using the phone in a car, in a meeting, or at home. Hence, the features of your value proposition will be diff  erent depending on which context(s) you are focusing. 56

surrounded by an ocean of tempting value propo-sitions that all compete for the same limited slots of attention.   Very diff  erent value propositions may address similar jobs, pains, and gains. For example, our movie theater chain competes for customer atten-tion not only with other movie theaters but also with a broad range of alternative options: renting a movie at home, going out to dinner, visiting a spa, or maybe even attending an online virtual art exhibit with 3D glasses.  Strive to understand what your customers really care about. Investigate their jobs, pains, and gains beyond what your own value proposi-tion directly addresses in order to imagine totally new or substantially improved ones. 
Understand your customers beyond 
your solution. Unearth the jobs, pains, and gains that matter to them in order to understand how to improve your value proposition or invent new ones. 58

Use the customer profile to visualize 
what matters to customers. Specify 
their jobs, pains, and gains. Communi -
cate the profile across your organiza -
tion as a one-page actionable  
document that creates a shared 
customer understanding. Apply it as 
a “scoreboard” to track if assumed 
customer jobs, pains, and gains exist 
when you talk to real customers.Value Map
Use the value map to make explicit 
how you believe your products and 
services will ease pains and create 
gains. Communicate the map across 
your organization as a one-page 
document that creates a shared 
understanding of how you intend to 
create value. Apply it as a “score -
board” to track if your products actu -
ally ease pains and gains when you 
test them with customers.  fit

The search for value propositions 
that meet customer jobs, pains, and gains is a continuous back and forth between designing prototypes and testing them. The process is iterative rather than sequential. The goal of Value Proposition Design is to test ideas as quickly as possible in order to learn, create better designs, and test again.
